App Idea: A book searching app similar to Goodreads that allows you to create lists and save books to your library. Also contains a page that incorporates the Spotify API to create a playlist based off a given book.

**User Roles**

 - The user wants to search for and create and save lists of
   books and generate playlists based off books/genres.

**User Stories**

 1. As a user, I want to be able to search by title or author.
 2. As a user, I want to click on a book to get more details, so I can see a summary and rating information.
 3. I want an option to choose whether the generated playlist contains strictly instrumental music since some users prefer that while reading. 
 4. As a user, I want to write private notes about the books in my lists so I can remember certain things about them.
 5. As a user, I want to see similar recommended books after I finish a book I liked.
 6. As a user, I want to choose the approximate length of my generated playlist.
 7. As a user, I want to have a profile page with stats like how many books/pages I've read, when I joined, etc.
 8. As a user, I want to have a library page that contains all my lists and saved books.
 9. As a user, I want to have an explore page where I can search for other books.
 10. As a user, I want to have a header that contains a link to the home page, explore page, and playlist generation page.
